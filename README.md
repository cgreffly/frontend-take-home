## Future / Real World Improvements

### Data Table

I'd use TanStack Table if this had been going into production because I would want the ability to support sorting, column resizing or row selection. It seemed like overkill for this project though.

### Styling

I decided to use Radix Primitives instead of Themes because I wanted to avoid overrides and I like the blank slate flexibility. I also use Radix Primatives at my current job and feel more comfortable with them.

### Error Handling

My error and empty states are pretty bare bones, simple text and toast notifications. With more time, I would build out full error handling pages and components, especially for the case of the tables not loading.
